GnomishVendorShrinker creates a simple, compact vendor frame, made to compliment
GnomishAuctionShrinker.  GVS brings an interface similar to Auctioneer's
"CompactUI" to the vendor frame.

## Features

* Simple one-line-per-item interface
* Scrolling list, none of that "paging" crap that makes navigation slow
* Clicking an item simply buys it, instead of picking up the item
* Alt-click buys a full stack (or as close to a full stack as is possible for
  limited-stock items)
* Ctrl- and shift-click behave as default (dress-up and paste link, respectively)
* Recipes you do not yet know are highlighted in blue
* Items you cannot use are highlighted in red
* Search box to help you find that item you're after on a vendor with hundreds of items

## Un-features

* No support for split-stack purchases, I'm not convinced it's needed.
